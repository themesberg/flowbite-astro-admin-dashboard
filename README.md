This project is a free and open-source UI admin dashboard template built with the components from [Flowbite](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite) and based on the utility-first [Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) framework featuring charts, tables, widgets, CRUD layouts, modals, drawers, and more.

This admin dashboard can quickly help you get started building an application for your project using the newest UI/UX development technologies in the open-source area including Tailwind CSS and Flowbite.

## 🌀 Built with Flowbite

The interactive components such as the navbars, modals, drawers, and tooltips are all based on the popular [open-source component library called Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) which enables us to use these elements by creating more complex set of pages and widgets inside a fully-fledged admin dashboard template.

## 💨 Tailwind CSS utility classes

All of the pages, widgets, and components are solely based on the utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS and it is compatible with the latest `v3.x` of the technology by automatically purging all of the classes based on the template paths.

## 📊 15 example pages

Get started with 15 advanced examples pages including two different layouts of a dashboard's homepage full of charts widgets, tables, datepickers, and statistics and also with two CRUD layout pages for products, users, a settings page, authentication pages for login and register and even custom 404 and 500 error pages.

## 🧱 Advanced components

This admin dashboard contains many advanced components both from Flowbite but also from other third-party libraries such as ApexCharts which have been customly tailored with Tailwind CSS classes and designed based on the [Flowbite Design System](https://flowbite.com/figma/).

## 📚 Flowbite documentation

If you want to use this project we recommend to also [study the component library](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) that we used to build this dashboard because you can use even more components from that library to enhance the examples that we've coded here already.

## ⚙️ Workflow

This product is built using the following widely used technologies:

- Tailwind CSS: [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Flowbite: [flowbite.com](http://flowbite.com/)
- Astro: [astro.build](https://astro.build/)

## 🚀 Development

### 🛠 Tools

Efforts have been put on fast **onboarding** and **developer experience**.

This project comes with extensive support for TypeScript, Astro, Tailwind, and VS Code.  
It comes with sensible defaults, a bit of opinions, plus some tricks to make it plays nice together.

- **TypeScript**: _strictest_ Astro's settings
- **ESLint**: featuring `astro-eslint-parser` + `eslint-plugin-astro`
- **Prettier**: featuring `prettier-plugin-astro` (bundled with `astro`)
- **Editorconfig**: conforming with prettier
- **VS Code**: extensions recommendations, tooling settings
- **Tailwind**: Astro integration (using Vite and PostCSS)
- **Flowbite**: dependencies (core, typography), settings
- **GitHub**: a [pre-configured workflow](./.github/workflows/demo.yaml) for deployment (using PNPM cache)
- **Sandboxes**: project is tested against and fully compatible with web containers

Feel free to hack those settings to cater for your own needs.

<!-- ## Quick start

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Make sure that you have Node.js and NPM installed
3. Install the project dependencies from the `package.json` file:

```
npm install
```

4. Create a local server on `localhost:1313` by running the following command:

```
npm run start
```

You can also build the project and get the distribution files inside the `public/` folder by running:

```
npm run build
```

You can instantly upload your project to Vercel by selecting the default HUGO configuration, but depending on your own tech stack whether it's React.js, Vue, Nuxt.js, Next.js or a back-end framework you can also just copy the layouts from this project inside your own tech stack.

Here's a list of compatible technologies and guides for Flowbite and Tailwind CSS: -->

### JavaScript Frameworks

The awesome open-source community also built and currently maintains the following standalone libraries for React, Vue, Svelte, and Angular:

- [🌀 Flowbite React Library](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react)
- [🍀 Flowbite Vue Library](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-vue)
- [🎸 Flowbite Svelte Library](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-svelte)
- [📕 Flowbite Angular Library](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-angular)

We also wrote integration guides for the following front-end frameworks and libraries:

- [📝 Flowbite with React guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/react/)
- [📝 Flowbite with Next.js guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/next-js/)
- [📝 Flowbite with Vue guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/vue/)
- [📝 Flowbite with Nuxt.js guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/nuxt-js/)
- [📝 Flowbite with Svelte guide](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/svelte/)

### Back-end Frameworks

Flowbite has a great integration with most of the back-end frameworks because it relies on vanilla JavaScript:

- [📚 Using Flowbite with Laravel](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/laravel/)
- [🚊 Using Flowbite with Ruby on Rails 7](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/rails/)
- [🐸 Using Flowbite with Django](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/django/)
- [🌶 Using Flowbite with Flask](https://flowbite.com/docs/getting-started/flask/)
